This test systems is for Martini2.2:
1 ubiquitin molecule in a water box, with ions.

I generated the elastic network for the protein using the first version of it, which
uses bond type 6 for the elastic bonds (elnedyn uses bond type 1).

minimized.gro is the output of a 40ns sims.
I wanted to see if I could spot any major difference with the elnedyn model.
I didn't, RMSD on the BB beads is within the same range as with elnedyn or the go model in Martini 3.
